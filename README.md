# Pocket Casts Media Control
This is a fork that adds support for `https://playbeta.pocketcasts.com`. All credit goes to [Tobias Thyssen](https://github.com/tobiasthyssen).

Also a call out for [John Taylor](https://github.com/JohnLTaylor) who did most of this work in a [pull request](https://github.com/tobiasthyssen/pocket-casts-media-controls/pull/3) that has been waiting for several months.

You can find the original extension [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/media-key-support-for-poc/edloapkoalgpnkdknpmclplmfkecgpai), and here is the [original code](https://github.com/tobiasthyssen/pocket-casts-media-controls).

I will gladly remove this if/when the orignal extension is updated or upon request from Tobias.

Thanks for making our lives a little better Tobias!
